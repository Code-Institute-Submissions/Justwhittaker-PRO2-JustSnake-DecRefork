# JUST SNAKE

In the early 2000's as technology increased and cellphones had become more accessible with multiple capibilites.
Cellphone games such as Snake came standard with your cellphone such as the popular Nokia 3110, we all tried betting our top scores.

I have decided to recreate the poplular game for everyone to enjoy in both the classic format for celluar use as well as for the pc.

## UX
I developed this website to bring back the joy of playing snake on our cellphones,
I wanted the website to be user friendly, basic, easy to navigate and quick to respond.

I used Bootstrap4 to assit with the mobile friendly code to ensure that the game can be played anywhere.

I wanted a seasoned gamer still to have fun, I want to perform an quick and simple game, so that I can achieve a goal.
I designed my wireframe on Balsamiq please follow the link to find the preview
